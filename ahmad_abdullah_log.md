We had a meeting with the team to start organizing the project, to determine which team everyone might want to be on, and break it into tribes based on people's interests. I joined the backend team or the mobile team if we are working with native languages since I have worked with cross-platform frameworks for a long time. However, we have determined that everyone would be flexible and support each other as needed.

Since our product owner could not attend to the meeting he asked me to stand up instead of him in this day as a product owner. Since i did not had the time to create product backlogs and  i tried to figure out what to do on the go, We started with a project group meeting where we discussed what we did the previous week and what we want to do this week, and the backend team decided to adopt Firebase as a database.

We had a meeting with the rest of the backend developers, and we built the connection to Firebase, spoke about how our firestore structure would look, and Abdel and I worked on the firebase further so that we could read and write data in the database. Finally, we established a connection between our API and Firebase.

We held a mid sprint meeting to make it clearer on what we should work on. 
Because until this day we did not know how to function as a team. Since our product owner did not create a user story backlog i created our backlog based on what we planned to do in the original sprint meeting and based on the product itself. it made it much more clearer for the rest of the group and we could create more functionalities as a team. I took the getPointById endpoint.

```
 we held a normal standup meeting to review review what we did and how much time we had left on what we started with, and we made a few adjustments to the database structure, and the function was eventually completed later that day. and i made a pull request to the main brach and still waiting for my code to be reviewed and accepted by my fellow team mates to merge it into the main brach, i requested Abdel and do won.
