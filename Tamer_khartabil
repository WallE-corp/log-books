Meeting after the lecture to decide who should work with what

2022-03-30
Meeting (4 hours) to plan the project
 
I went through how mbot works

2022-03-31
Download Arduino IDE and makeblock, get started with the robot (drive forward until he finds the line)

I bought a cable (usb to micro usb) to connect the raspberry Pi with Arduino

Discuss how communication between the Pi and Arduino should be (come to the conclusion that we need to work with serial communications)

2022-04-06
Managed to connect the Pi with the Arduino through serial communications (we can send data from the Arduino to the Pi and from the Pi to the Arduino)

2022-04-07
Started implementing so the robot follows the tape to be able to map.

Connect the camera with the Pi and tested if it works (we could take a picture and save it in the Pi)

Tested running the robot over a socket connection (it was possible to control the robot)
