Meeting after the lecture to decide who should work with what

2022-03-30
Meeting (4 hours) to plan the project
 
I went through how mbot works

2022-03-31
Download Arduino IDE and makeblock, get started with the robot (drive forward until he finds the line)

2022-04-05
I bought a cable (usb to micro usb) to connect the raspberry Pi with Arduino

Discuss how communication between the Pi and Arduino should be (come to the conclusion that we need to work with serial communications)

2022-04-06
Managed to connect the Pi with the Arduino through serial communications (we can send data from the Arduino to the Pi and from the Pi to the Arduino)

2022-04-07
Started implementing so the robot follows the tape to be able to map.

Connect the camera with the Pi and tested if it works (we could take a picture and save it in the Pi)

Tested running the robot over a socket connection (it was possible to control the robot)

2022-04-11
A meeting to discuss how far we have come with the project. we discuss how we intend to send position to the backend 
(by using gyrp sensor and accelerometer we can calculate the velocity and angle) and how we do when we discover an object 
(we reverse a bit and then turn randomly).

2022-04-13
I, Tim and Erik managed to put installations for gyroscope in the Arduino IDE to get the direction,
we also tried to set up the insallation for the accelerometer(ADXL345) in the Raspberry Pi to get the acceleration to 
be able to calculate the velocity. It was copmlex to calculate the velocity to get (x,y) coordinates.

2022-04-14
After a long reseach, we realized that we could calculate the velocity by calculating the RPM and the diameter of the wheel.
We tried this method and we managed to get the velocity of the robot. Since we have the velocity and the direction (the angle
from gyro scope), the dead reckoning algorithm should be usefull to get (x,y) coordinates.

Made some changes in the code to make it looks better (namn variables and structure)

2022-04-15
Meeting with the whole group to discuss what we have done and what we are going to do next week

2022-04-21
The calculation of (x,y) is done, we made some tests to make sure the we get right coordinates. 

implement a function to detect obstacle, so the robot will detect the obstacle if the distance less than 11 cm, 
then reverse and turn randomly

2022-04-22
Meeting with the group, we decided to connect the robot to the backend next week och see if we could send something 
to the backend

2022-04-28
Can not send data to the backend beasuce the server is not up.
The line follower sensing function is implemented now. 
Setting up switch case to handle either manual or automatic mode.

2022-04-29
Meeting with the group to discuss how we should send some data to the backend next week.

2022-05-03
We booked a backend meeting to test send something from robot to backend

2022-05-04
connection from robot to backend works.
with the help of the backend team we could send (x,y) coordinates, and we also send a picture and save it in 
the database (firebase) when the robot detect obstacles.
we decided to send data from the mobile to the robot via the backend tomorrow.

2022-05-05 
One of the backend team member did a test simulation, to test the connection between the mobil and the robot over a socket. 
So we tried to controlling the robot through test simulation by sending "forward", "backwrad", "left", "right" and it works. 

Since Raspberry pi zero is quite slow, we got a Raspberry Pi 4 + camera from Anderas och we switchit to it.

2022-05-06
Meeting with the whole group to discuss what is everyone doing, about the doucmentation and what is left for every part.

2022-05-11
since we use serial commincation between Raspberry Pi and Arduino , we got some error when we sending and reciving data at the same time. 
The problem was solved by switching how we sent the data.

2022-05-12
Made sure that every functions are done och ready to test next week.

2022-05-17
A meeting with the mobile team at university to test controlling the robol over a socket via mobile. 
The manual and auto controlling works as expected.

2022-05-19
The mobil team still working on drawing the map.
By using the test simulation that made of Joshua, we made sure that the backend is reiving (x,y) coordinates and the image, 
and save them in the database (firebase).

2022-05-20
Tim and Erik worked on writing the software documentation and lessons learn documentation, I was with the mobile to test if drawing the map works. 
The obstacal and the map is not drawing as expected, mobile team worked on it and they fixed.
We changed the robots battery and we made the final video for the presenation.

2022-05-21
upload the final code (both Raspberry Pi and Arduino) on the github.
